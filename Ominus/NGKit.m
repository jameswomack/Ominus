// Use camelCase for inline variable and property names
// Use TileCamelCase for class, function, type names
// Namespace all classes, categories, protocols and public constants
// Use method names that clearly state exactly what the methods does
// Consider alternate namespaced getters/setters on "Vendor" (incl. Apple) category ...

// Prefer dot dyntax for accessing values on instance and class objects
// Insist on bracket syntax for verb methods, i.e. methods focused on side effects

// Create class/instance initializer couplets

     if ((self = super.init))
     {
         self.foo = foo;
